Numerical simulation of red blood cell flows through capillaries is a important investigational tool in the biological sciences.
The ability to rapidly evaluate the impact of blood vessel and cell geometries, plasma viscosity, and particulate densities on macroscopic physiology is crucial to pursuing further biological understanding. 
Experimental techniques are costly and time consuming, while analytical approaches are often of limited practical use, ultimately underscoring the importance of numerical methods.

In this work, we construct such a simulation, capable of simulating microliters of blood flowing through realistic vasculature.
Due to the micrometer length scales of typical capillaries, we can model the blood plasma as a Stokesian fluid and red blood cells as inextensible, deformable membranes.
By reformulating the viscous flow as a set of boundary integral equations, we are able to produce a method that has optimal complexity, is high-order accurate, and capable of handling dense particulate suspensions in complex geometries.

A key component of the blood flow simulation is a robust solver for elliptic partial differential equations applied to Stokes flow.
A core component is a fast algorithm to compute the value of the solution near and on the domain boundary, known as \qbkix.
We provide a set of algorithms to guarantee the accuracy of \qbkix on piecewise smooth surfaces.
Leveraging this solver in a confined blood flow simulation involves advecting particulates along the resulting flow trajectory. 
Large timesteps are required for an efficient simulation, but performed naively can cause collisions among cells and with the vessel wall. 
We present collision detection and resolution algorithms for the red blood cells and the blood vessel.
We parallelize the fluid solver and the collision algorithms and scale them to thousands of cores.
