\section{Conclusion\label{sec:conclusion}}
We have shown that our parallel platform for the simulation of red
blood cell flows is capable of accurately resolved long-time
simulation of red blood cell flows in complex vessel networks. We are
able to achieve realistic cell volume fractions of over 47\%, while avoiding
collisions between cells or with the blood vessel
walls. Incorporating blood vessels into red blood cell
simulations requires solving a
boundary integral equation, for which we use \gmres.
Each \gmres iteration computes a matrix-vector product,
which in turn involves singular quadrature and an \fmm
evaluation; the latter dominates the computation time. To avoid collisions,
we solve a nonlinear complementarity problem in the implicit part of
each time step. This requires repeated assembly of sparse matrices that, in
principle, couple all cells globally. Nevertheless, solving this
complementarity system yields close-to-optimal strong
and weak scaling in our tests.
