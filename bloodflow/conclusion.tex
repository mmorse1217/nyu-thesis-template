\section{Conclusion\label{sec:conclusion}}
We have shown that our parallel platform for the simulation of red
blood cell flows is capable of accurately resolved long-time
simulation of red blood cell flows in complex vessel networks. We are
able to achieve realistic cell volume fractions of over 47\%, while avoiding
collisions between cells or with the blood vessel
walls. Incorporating blood vessels into red blood cell
simulations requires solving a
boundary integral equation, for which we use \gmres.
Each \gmres iteration computes a matrix-vector product,
which in turn involves singular quadrature and an \fmm
evaluation; the latter dominates the computation time. To avoid collisions,
we solve a nonlinear complementarity problem in the implicit part of
each time step. This requires repeated assembly of sparse matrices that, in
principle, couple all cells globally. Nevertheless, solving this
complementarity system yields close-to-optimal strong
and weak scaling in our tests. Overall, the vast majority of compute
time is spent in \fmm evaluations, which implies that the scaling behavior of our
simulation is dominated by the scalability of the \fmm implementation.
As discussed at the end of \cref{ss:scalability}, in the
future, we will employ a local singular quadrature scheme that will
allow us to significantly reduce the time spent in \fmm evaluations. This
will not only speed up the overall simulation but
also improve the weak and strong scalability of our simulation platform.
