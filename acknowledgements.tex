I would first and foremost like to thank my advisor, Denis Zorin, for his advise and guidance throughout my PhD. I would also like to thank my committee members, Georg Stadler, Marsha Berger, Michael O'Neil and Michael Overton, for their feedback on my thesis and participating as committee members.

I'm grateful for the support of Shenglong Wang at NYU HPC, who has always gone above and beyond to help the cluster users and helped me out of many last minute jams.

I must thank Nancy Wrinkle and Joan Birman, whose excitement and passion for topology has helped me to maintain my own passions.

I want to thank Michael Shelley, for many valuable discussions and the chance to work at the Flatiron Institute.
I'm similarly grateful to Harper Langston, Pierre-David Letourneau, Julia Wei, Mitchell Harris, Rich Lethin and everyone else at Reservoir Labs for a wonderful internship and the opportunity to experience research from a new perspective.

I have had the great fortune to meet and work with many wonderful people during my time at NYU.

I am deeply thankful for the guidance and support of Abtin Rahimian, for a fruitful collaboration and teaching me to be a proficient researcher and engineer, and without whom this thesis would not have been possible. 
I'm equally grateful for Libin Lu, who has been not only a great collaborator but a good friend.

Most importantly, I must thank my family for their love, support and unending patience.
