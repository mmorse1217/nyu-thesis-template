I would first and foremost like to thank my advisor, Denis Zorin, for his advise and guidance. I would also like to thank my committee members, Georg Stadler, Marsha Berger, Mike O'Neil and Michael Overton, for their feedback on my thesis and participating in this process.

I am deeply grateful for the guidance and support of Abtin Rahimian.
At an early stage in my career, he invested a tremendous effort in my development by teaching me to be a proficient researcher and engineer and to think in a critical manner in all areas of life.
Wtihout his support and guidance, this thesis would not have been possible and I would not be the person I am today.

I'm grateful for the unending support of Shenglong Wang at NYU HPC. 
He has always gone above and beyond to help the cluster users and ensure that everything is running smoothly.

I have had the great fortune to meet many wonderful people during my time at NYU.
