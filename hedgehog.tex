This chapter introduces a simple, high-order boundary solver for elliptic partial differential equations (\pdes) in \threed complex geometries called \qbkix.
It is based on the work \cite{morse2020robust} with Abtin Rahimian and Denis Zorin.

Boundary integral equation methods have many computational advantages over conventional approaches, but the necessity of evaluating singular/near-singular integrals remains a complicated challenge.
The main contribution of \qbkix is its algorithmic simplicity.
The singular/near-singular quadrature scheme decouples quadrature evaluation from the regularization required to accurately evaluate layer potentials.
\qbkix only requires values of the solution at points, which can be computed with a standard point \fmm.
This overcomes a key hurdle in the development of fast singular quadrature methods.

This elliptic \pde solver ultimately allows us to solve Laplace, Stokes and linear elasticity equations in complex geometries.
As will see in the next chapter, by assuming that the fluid flowing through capillaries behaves like a Stokesian fluid, we can leverage \qbkix as a building block in a large scale blood flow simulation.
