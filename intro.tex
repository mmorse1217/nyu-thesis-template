Microscale particulate flows play a pivotal role in many biophysical settings.
In particular, blood flows through vasculature can be modeled with reasonable accuracy by a collection of deformable particles called \textit{vesicles} suspended in a Newtonian fluid.
A clear understanding blood circulation through capillaries would shed light on important yet complex phenomena such as vasodilation, vasoconstriction, thrombosis and clotting.
The ability to simulate such flows with modern computers would provide a means to computationally investigate these phenomena with an unprecidented level of control and resolution and is a crucial milestone in the pursuit of the next generation of biological advances.

The tools required for blood flow simulation can also be applied in other biological settings.
Deterministic lateral displacement microfluidic chips are able to sort particles suspended in a fluid flow by varying the geometry of a collection of pillars tiling the length of the device.
By simulating such a device, one can optimize the device shape and expensive trial-and-error through manufacturing \cite{kabacaouglu2019sorting}.
